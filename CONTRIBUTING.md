# Contributing to the Trust and Safety Textbook

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source Trust and Safety textbook! This guide explains how you can help improve this educational resource.

## Copyright Assignment

By contributing to this project, **you must assign your copyright to Alex Stamos**. This assignment is necessary because:

1. Once the book is ready, our intention is to publish a snapshot in dead tree format with Stripe Press. This requires Alex to sign all kinds of terrifying paperwork saying that he owns the copyright to the content and indemnifies a multi-billion dollar company.
2. It allows us to contribute the book to other trust and safety projects in the future that might have slightly different open-source licenses.

However, we are committed to maintaining this textbook as an open educational resource. Even after publication:

- The book will **always remain available for free online** under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))
- The open source nature of the project ensures continued accessibility for educators, students, and practitioners worldwide
